# mbta

In this lab we combined our knowledge of Javascript, HTML and CSS to create and display a 
detailed map of the MBTA red line trains. Each location had a specific pin for the stop's
specific longitude and latitude and all the stops were connected with a red polyline.
A css file is implemented to display the Google map, which is centered specifically
at south station.

Collaborated with one Stamatios Aleiferis

Took approximately 8.5 hours.
