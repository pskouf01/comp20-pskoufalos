In this lab we determined our own geolocation on the map using JavaScript objects.
Once the location was found we were to create an information window with the closest
Red Line station connected by a polyline and upon clicking it, the infowindow would tell you the upcoming trains. We used JSON and parsing to gather incoming data regarding the timing and location of each upcoming train and calculated the distance between two set Geopoints using the Haversine Formula. We used code given to us by stack overflow (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript) to calculate these distances.

Collaborated with one Stamatios Aleiferis

Took approximately 11 hours.
