# mbta part 3

In this lab we connected our json file to our server so to be used in the mbta files directly coming from our servers on heroku. The package "needle" was used to obtain the json file and obtain the content of the originial JSON data feed from a given file and is enabled by Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. Basically we were able to upload a file to our server as its own page and then filter that through to our mbta connecting it for use in obtaining the JSON file.

Collaborated with Stam Aleiferis and Kiki Chan.

This lab took approximately 8 hours.
