#messages part 2

In this lab we modified our previous implimentation of the Messages lab.
Here we practiced using XMLHttpRequest and JSON parsing methods in order to 
output a message onto a local server. This was done using associative arrays 
and then modeled and designed using CSS

Special Question: They are not supposed to work, the second because there is no server running to issue the HTTP request that is need to launch the webpage, and the first because of the same origin policy dissallowing you to withdraw a HTML page from a different server.

Discussed with one Stamatios Aleiferis.

Time for Completion: roughly 2.5 hours
