Added css code that manipulated width and height of a full picture with ten slots and separated 10 slots by pixel structure. Whenever the page width changed so should the picture to each specific slot. Unfortunately I could not figure out why only one would change at a time. 

Collaborated with Stamatios Aleiferis.

Approximately 3 hours of work.
